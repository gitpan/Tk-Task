NAME
    Tk::Task - allow multiple "tasks" to proceed at once

DESCRIPTION
    `Tk::Task' is a module to allow a lengthy operation to be subdivided
    into smaller pieces, with time to process events between pieces. For
    example, a program that loaded a large number of records from a database
    could make the load process a task, allowing the program to remain
    responsive to events--for example, to handle a Stop button!

    The steps of each task are executed at idle time, one step each time,
    while "normal" processing (handling the event loop) continues. You might
    use a task to do simple animations such as turning cards over in a game,
    or for other purposes. For example, the Tk::TriangleTree widget uses a
    Tk::Task to animate the disclosure triangle.

    A Task is *not* the same as a thread. It is more like a "poor man's"
    version of threading. However, this is often quite good enough.

CHANGES
    Version 1.1 allows a Task to be created from any widget, not just
    a MainWindow.
